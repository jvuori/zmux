# ============================================================================
# Resize Mode Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This mode is activated with: Ctrl+n
# Provides Zellij-like resize functionality
# Most bindings are in keybindings.conf under the "resize" key table

# Additional resize mode bindings (Zellij-compatible)
# These complement the main bindings in keybindings.conf

# Note: Main resize bindings (arrow keys, hjkl, capital letters, =, -)
# are defined in keybindings.conf to match Zellij exactly
