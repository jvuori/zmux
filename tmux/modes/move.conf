# ============================================================================
# Move Mode Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This mode is activated with: Ctrl+h
# Provides Zellij-like pane movement
# Most bindings are in keybindings.conf under the "move" key table

# Additional move mode bindings (Zellij-compatible)
# These complement the main bindings in keybindings.conf

# Note: Main move bindings (arrow keys, hjkl, n/Tab, p)
# are defined in keybindings.conf to match Zellij exactly
